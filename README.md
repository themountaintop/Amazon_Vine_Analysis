## Summary

With 51% of the Vine reviews getting positive reviews and only 39% of the non-Vine reviews getting positive rewviews, there is a possible positivity bias for paid reviews. To better understand if there is a bias we could gather the mean, median, and mode for both the Vine and non-Vine star ratings.
